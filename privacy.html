    <strong> Effective Date:  October 1, 2002 <br> <br>

    THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.  PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY. <br> <br>

    IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT DR. SAHOURI.</strong> <br> <br>

    Your medical information is personal. We are committed to protecting your medical information. We create a record of the care and services you receive at this office. We need this record to provide you with quality care and to comply with certain legal requirements. This Notice applies to all of the records of your care generated by this office whether made by your personal physician or one of the office's employees. <br> <br>

    This Notice will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose your medical information. This Notice will also describe your rights and certain obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of your medical information. <br> <br>

    This office is required by law to: <br> <br>

(1) make sure that medical information that identifies you is kept private; <br> <br>

(2) give you this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you; and <br> <br>

(3) follow the terms of the Notice that is currently in effect. <br> <br>

    How this Office May Use and Disclose Your Medical Information: <br> <br>

    The following describes the different ways that your medical information may be used or disclosed by this office. For clarification we have included some examples. Not every possible use or disclosure is specifically mentioned. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose your medical information will fit within one of these general categories: <br> <br>

    <strong>For Treatment.</strong>  We will use medical information about you to provide you with medical treatment and services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians and other office personnel who are involved in providing you medical treatment. <br> <br>

    <strong>For Payment.</strong>  We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services you receive at this office may be billed to and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company or a third party. For example, we may need to give your health plan information about treatment you received here so your health plan will pay us or reimburse you for the treatment. We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment. <br> <br>

    <strong>For Health Care Operations.</strong>  We may use and disclose medical information about you for office operations. These uses and disclosures are necessary to run our office and make sure that all of our patients receive quality care. For example, we may use medical information to review our treatment and services and to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you. We may also combine medical information about many of our patients to decide what additional services the office should offer, what services are not needed, and whether certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, and other office personnel for review and learning purposes. We may remove information that identifies you from this set of medical information so others may use it to study health care and health care delivery without learning the identity of the specific patients. <br> <br>

    <strong>Appointment Reminders.</strong>  We may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care at this office. <br> <br>

    <strong>Treatment Alternatives.</strong>  We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you. <br> <br>

    <strong>Health-Related Benefits and Services.</strong>  We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you. <br> <br>

    <strong>Research.</strong>  Under certain circumstances, we may use and disclose medical information about you for research purposes. For example, a research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of all patients who received one medication to those who received another for the same condition. <br> <br>

    <strong>As Required By Law.</strong>  We will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law. For example, disclosure may be required by Workers' Compensation statutes and various public health statutes in connection with required reporting of certain diseases, child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, adverse drug reactions, etc. <br> <br>

    <strong>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.</strong>  We may use and disclose medical information about you when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to help prevent the threat. <br> <br>

    <strong>Health Oversight Activities.</strong>  We may disclose medical information to a governmental or other oversight agency for activities authorized by law. For example, disclosures of your medical information may be made in connection with audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure renewals, etc. <br> <br>

    <strong>Lawsuits and Disputes.</strong>  If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may use your medical information to defend the office or to respond to a court order. <br> <br>

    <strong>Law Enforcement.</strong>  We may release medical information about you if required by law when asked to do so by a law enforcement official. <br> <br>

    <strong>Coroners and Medical Examiners.</strong>  We may release medical information to a coroner or medical examiner to identify a deceased person or determine the cause of death. <br> <br>
